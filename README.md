# RashIO Mobile Application

## Background

Skin diseases are often considered normal, but in some cases skin diseases can be dangerous and deadly, moreover skin diseases can be contagious. Skin diseases that appear are sometimes difficult to distinguish because they have almost similar symptoms for the lay eye. Sources circulating on the internet sometimes provide information that is general enough to make it difficult for sufferers to ascertain the skin disease they are experiencing. Eczema, Psoriasis and Dermatitis are skin diseases that have the same skin conditions, namely itching, redness, and inflammation. Therefore, we have the idea to create an application that can help ordinary people to be able to distinguish the skin disease based only on the rash or the redness on the skin.
